# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

### Objective
- build an extensible game engine with an unbeatable computer player that uses the minimax algorithm to play tic-tac-toe. 

---
**Concepts:**
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and composition
- Abstract classes
- Data classes
- Type hints
- Regular expressions
- Caching
- Recursion

# Steps
1. Model the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Domain
- Create the folder directory
- Edit the `pyproject.toml` file.
```
The pyproject.toml file is a standard configuration file using the TOML format for specifying minimum build system requirements for Python projects. The concept was introduced in PEP 518 and is now the recommended way of adding packaging metadata and configuration in Python. You’re going to need this to install the tic-tac-toe library into your virtual environment.
```
- Define the tic-tac-toe domain model objects in `models.py`
- Represent the Square Grid of Cells [**game’s board is represented by a three-by-three grid of cells in the classic tic-tac-toe. Each cell can be empty or marked with either a cross or a naught.**]
- Take a snapshot of the Player's move. [**model the player’s move so that artificial intelligence can evaluate and choose the best option.**]

An object representing the player’s move in tic-tac-toe should primarily answer the following two questions:
```
Player’s Mark: What mark did the player place?
Mark’s Location: Where was it placed?
```

A move object can’t validate itself without knowing some of the game details, such as the starting player’s mark, which aren’t available to it. You’ll check whether a given move is valid, along with validating a specific grid cell combination, in a class responsible for managing the game’s state.

- Determine the Game State:

```
A tic-tac-toe game can be in one of several states, including three possible outcomes:

The game hasn’t started yet.
The game is still going on.
The game has finished in a tie.
The game has finished with player X winning.
The game has finished with player O winning.
You can determine the current state of a tic-tac-toe game based on two parameters:

The combination of cells in the grid
The mark of the starting player
```

By convention, the player who marks the cells with crosses starts the game, hence the default value of Mark("X") for the starting player’s mark. 

- Introduce a Separate Validation Layer
- So, create `exceptions.py` and `validatiors.py` for GameState Validation.

- Discard Incorrect Game States

```
A starting player has an advantage, so when they win, they’ll have left more marks than their opponent. Conversely, the second player is at a disadvantage, so they can only win the game by making an equal number of moves as the starting player.
```

- Simulate Moves by Producing New Game States
