# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

### Objective
- build an extensible game engine with an unbeatable computer player that uses the minimax algorithm to play tic-tac-toe. 

# Steps
1. Model the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Domain
- Create the folder directory
- Edit the `pyproject.toml` file.
```
The pyproject.toml file is a standard configuration file using the TOML format for specifying minimum build system requirements for Python projects. The concept was introduced in PEP 518 and is now the recommended way of adding packaging metadata and configuration in Python. Youâ€™re going to need this to install the tic-tac-toe library into your virtual environment.
```
- Define the tic-tac-toe domain model objects in `models.py`
- Represent the Square Grid of Cells
